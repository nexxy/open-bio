Emily Rose or more prominently known as Nexxy is a pirate captain who sails the seas of JavaScript combating
onslaughts of Blocking IO and Latency with a barrage of Async and Event Loops. When at port you can find Nexxy
eating Raspberry Pis, playing puppet master to swarms of Quadrocopters and volunteering her time to babysit
the children of #node.js.
